    aboutme: `Hi, I'm Nihal Gupta, B-Tech Computer Science student at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, Delhi. 
    I am a full-stack developer well versed in front-end with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS , and back-end with Django and Flask. I also have hands-on experience in writing Python Automation Scripts.
    
    Being a Tech-Lover, I am always fascinated by all the new technologies that are trending in the industry and I love to keep myself updated with them. 
    
    Apart from being a Tech-Person, I also like to work for the community because I think sharing is the most important thing that one should do for personal growth in life.
    
    I'm open for any kind of work and collaboration. 
    You can reach me at nihalgupta11213@gmail.com`,
